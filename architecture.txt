Backend Architecture Diagram Description:
1. Client Layer:

Description: The user interface or external systems that interact with your application (e.g., web app, mobile app, external APIs).
Interactions: Sends requests to and receives responses from the Web Server.
2. Web Server (Gunicorn):

Description: A production-grade web server that handles HTTP requests.
Interactions:
Receives requests from clients.
Forwards requests to the Flask API Layer.
Sends back the responses to the clients.
3. Flask API Layer:

Components:
API Endpoints: Handle different types of requests (e.g., /predict, /getResults).
Request Handler: Validates and processes incoming data.
Model Loader: Loads the serialized machine learning model.
Prediction Engine: Generates predictions using the model.
Interactions:
Receives processed requests from the Web Server.
Interacts with the Database Layer for data retrieval and storage.
In the case of background tasks, pushes tasks to the Background Processing component.
Sends back responses to the Web Server.
4. Database Layer (MongoDB/Redis):

MongoDB:
Function: Stores persistent data like predictions, user profiles, logs.
Interactions: Receives read/write requests from the Flask API Layer.
Redis:
Function: Manages caching, session data, or temporary data storage.
Interactions: Stores and retrieves temporary data for the Flask API Layer.
5. Background Processing (Celery):

Description: Manages time-consuming or scheduled tasks asynchronously.
Interactions:
Receives tasks from the Flask API Layer (e.g., model retraining, batch processing).
Can interact with the Database Layer for data operations.
Runs tasks independently without affecting the API's performance.
6. Load Balancer (Optional):

Function: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple server instances.
Interactions: Sits between the clients and the Web Server to manage traffic and ensure high availability.
7. Containerization & Orchestration (Docker & Kubernetes):

Docker:
Function: Packages the application and its environment into containers.
Kubernetes:
Function: Manages and orchestrates the containers, handling deployment, scaling, and networking.
Interactions: Encapsulates components like the Web Server, Flask API, and Background Processing for consistent deployment and scalability.
